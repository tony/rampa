# ADR 002: Native Boundary and Execution Architecture

Status: Proposed
Date: 2026-05-28

## Context

This project is a Python project that may use Rust for native implementation work. ADR 001
governs one narrow shape of native code: a drop-in accelerator that replaces a public Python
callable, class, method, attribute, or module behavior while preserving the observable Python
API.

That model is necessary, but not sufficient. Python/Rust projects commonly use native code in
other shapes:

- an in-process engine that consumes a normalized plan or batch built by Python;
- an independent worker or binary that communicates with Python through a protocol;
- a Rust core exposed through one or more bindings.

Those shapes are not simple accelerators. They do not merely stand in for one Python callable.
They have different boundary costs, lifecycle risks, packaging risks, and test obligations.
Treating them as drop-in accelerators hides those risks. Treating all native work as an engine
or worker is also wrong, because it can avoid the strict compatibility rules that apply to public
Python APIs.

This ADR is domain-agnostic. It defines how a Python-first project chooses and governs a
Python/Rust boundary. Application-specific semantics belong in later ADRs.

## Decision

The project adopts a default of no native code, and a cost-ordered ladder of three native
integration shapes for the exceptions: **accelerator**, **engine**, and **worker**. Each native
boundary is assigned to exactly one shape before code is written. The assigned shape fixes the
boundary rules, test obligations, and governing ADR.

### Default rule: no native code until measurement proves otherwise

Native code is not added because a path might be hot, because Rust is available, or because a
microbenchmark of a function in isolation looks good. It is added only after measurement of the
user-visible path shows a performance, latency, jitter, scale, memory, reliability, or
platform-interface limit that the Python implementation cannot resolve algorithmically or
structurally, against a named baseline.

The baseline is trunk for active development comparisons and a tag or release for release-facing
claims. The measurement must make the relevant boundary cost visible: how often Python crosses
into native code, how much data crosses, and how much work native code performs per crossing.

This default outranks every shape below. The shapes describe how to integrate native code once
the default is overcome, not whether native code is justified.

### Accelerator: drop-in for a public Python API

An accelerator replaces a pure Python public API with a native implementation that preserves
observable behavior. Python defines the meaning; Rust makes that same meaning faster.

Accelerators are governed by ADR 001.

Test: removing the native build changes nothing a user can observe except speed. The same
callable, argument forms, return shapes, exceptions, mutation behavior, equality, hashing,
ordering, serialization, context-manager behavior, and async behavior remain available.

Boundary: a public Python API to its native equivalent.

Tests: the same behavioral suite passes on both paths, with no tolerance unless the public API
already documents one.

An accelerator may be invoked once per public callable invocation. That does not make per-item
native crossings acceptable inside a larger internal loop unless the measured user-visible path
proves that this crossing pattern is better than a batched boundary.

Do not dress a simple accelerator up as an engine to avoid ADR 001 compatibility tests.

### Engine: in-process work over a plan, batch, or scoped native state

An engine consumes a normalized, typed plan or batch that Python builds, performs bounded
in-process work or owns explicitly scoped native state, and returns compact results through
coarse calls. Python remains the public authoring surface and source of truth. The native side
does not receive an arbitrary Python object graph and does not call back into Python inside
per-item loops.

Test: the boundary is crossed once per coarse unit, such as per run, per operation, per plan,
per batch, or per flush. Native work happens in-process and does not own an independent lifecycle
or event loop hidden from Python.

Boundary: Python-owned normalization to native-owned plan, batch, or scoped state.

Tests: semantic agreement with the Python path where behavior overlaps, plus tests for plan
normalization, error mapping, resource cleanup, lifecycle boundaries, repeated use, and failure
handling. Approximate reductions may use documented numeric tolerances, but native code must not
silently change public semantics.

During heavy native work that touches no Python objects, the engine releases the Python
interpreter so other Python threads can make progress. The policy is behavioral: heavy native
work yields the interpreter. A clean implementation may choose the exact API spelling for that
binding.

Shape analogues: Polars-style Python plan construction with native execution; pydantic-core-style
schema construction with native validation.

### Worker: independent lifecycle behind a message-passing protocol

A worker runs independently of the Python caller and communicates by message passing rather than
by synchronous in-process calls. The distinguishing axis is message passing vs. direct FFI, not
the operating-system process. A separate binary, a separate process, or a long-lived native
background thread that talks to Python over a channel can all be workers if they own an
independent lifecycle.

Test: the boundary is a versioned protocol or channel, and the native side runs its own
lifecycle. The two sides could be versioned, deployed, or replaced independently as long as they
agree on the protocol.

Boundary: Python orchestrator to independent worker over a protocol.

Tests: protocol schema tests, compatibility tests across protocol versions, crash handling,
timeout handling, cancellation handling, resource cleanup, unsupported-capability rejection, and
equivalence tests against the Python runtime where behavior overlaps.

A worker crash, protocol mismatch, or unsupported capability is reported as an operation failure.
It is not masked by a silent switch to another execution model.

A new worker execution mode and protocol require their own ADR unless an existing approved
protocol already covers the mode. Once a protocol exists, additional workers implementing that
protocol are ordinary feature work if they do not change public semantics, packaging, or
lifecycle behavior.

Boundary analogues: pure-native tools such as native CLIs demonstrate the process-boundary and
no-hot-path-FFI model. A Python-orchestrated worker applies that idea through a versioned
protocol.

### Choosing the shape

Classify the boundary, not the component. A component with one boundary takes the narrowest shape
that honestly fits it. Evaluate in order and stop at the first match:

1. Replaces a public Python API, observable only as speed? Use accelerator and ADR 001.
2. Runs in-process over a typed plan, batch, or scoped native state, with coarse calls and no
   per-item Python callbacks? Use engine.
3. Runs independently behind a message-passing protocol or channel? Use worker.

A component that exposes more than one boundary must satisfy every shape it touches. For example,
a public callable backed by a background worker must satisfy the accelerator rules for the
callable surface and the worker rules for the worker surface.

When a single boundary is genuinely ambiguous between adjacent shapes, take the stricter higher
shape. An accelerator/engine straddle is governed as an engine. An engine/worker straddle is
governed as a worker. A boundary that fits none of the three is not designed yet. Design it
before writing native code.

## The boundary is the design

Design the boundary before writing native code. For an engine or worker, the shape is wrong if
Python crosses into native code for every item, event, sample, node, record, or callback. Move
the boundary up to a plan, batch, buffer, typed state object, or protocol message.

Avoid this engine/worker shape:

```text
Python loop
  -> native: process one item
  -> native: update one accumulator
  -> native: compute one next step
```

Prefer this shape:

```text
Python configuration / plan / batch
  -> native work over the coarse unit
  -> compact result returns to Python
```

Accelerators are the exception: they are per-call drop-ins by nature. Even then, internal
per-item accelerator crossings must be justified by user-visible measurement, not by a
microbenchmark alone.

Native code must not call Python callbacks inside per-item loops unless a later ADR approves that
bridge and includes boundary-cost measurements.

## Keep user code in the host language

Arbitrary user-provided Python code runs in Python. Native code may consume data, plans, schemas,
buffers, or declarative operations derived from user input, but it does not acquire the right to
execute arbitrary Python semantics just because it is faster at a subset.

If a native path supports only a declarative subset, that subset is a separate execution
capability. It must be explicit, opt-in, documented, and checked before execution starts.
Unsupported features are rejected before execution. They are not silently executed through Python
callbacks or delegated to a different execution model.

A later ADR may approve an embedded interpreter, compiled subset, callback bridge, or other
hybrid design, but that ADR must include the benchmark and semantic analysis for the bridge.

## Separate logic from binding

Native logic and the mechanism that exposes it to Python are different concerns. Keep native
logic in a core that has no Python-binding dependency when practical. Expose that core through
thin bindings for in-process use and, where applicable, through a worker for message-passing use.

This separation keeps the native core testable without Python, reduces coupling to CPython ABI
details, and allows one body of logic to be reached through more than one boundary without
entangling it with a single binding mechanism.

The ADR adopts the principle, not a required crate count or directory layout. A project may
choose the concrete structure that best fits its packaging and build workflow.

## Packaging

Keep the base package installable, importable, and usable without native code unless a later ADR
explicitly approves a native-required feature. Missing native code may remove acceleration or a
separately documented native capability. It must not remove the Python API or break import-time
behavior.

For in-process accelerators and engines, prefer one package while the native artifact remains
optional and the wheel matrix is manageable.

A worker may be packaged as a separate artifact because it is a different build target and may
have a different lifecycle. Shipping it inside the main package is acceptable while a single
distribution remains practical. Split distributions only on a documented trigger, such as
sustained wheel-matrix or build-maintenance pain that one distribution can no longer carry.

A stable ABI may be considered to reduce wheel-matrix pressure. It is not required by default.

## Testing and benchmarks

Test obligations follow the boundary shape:

- Accelerators use ADR 001 shared compatibility tests.
- Engines use Python-vs-native semantic tests where behavior overlaps, plus boundary, lifecycle,
  cleanup, error-mapping, and tolerance tests.
- Workers use protocol contract tests, lifecycle tests, crash/timeout/cancellation tests,
  capability negotiation tests, and equivalence tests where behavior overlaps.

Across all shapes, justify native code with measurement of the user-visible path against a named
baseline. Make the boundary-crossing count visible. Native tests never replace the Python-only
suite. A green native-enabled job does not compensate for a broken Python-only job.

## Native change record

A pull request that adds or changes native code includes this record. A reviewer rejects the
change if any field is missing, the shape is too weak for the boundary, or the measurement does
not justify native code.

```text
integration shape:       accelerator | engine | worker
user-visible behavior:   what this affects
boundary:                callable | plan/batch/state | message-passing
crossing frequency:      per public call | per run | per operation | per plan |
                         per batch | per flush | per protocol message
user Python in hot loop: no | bridged (cite approving ADR)
measurement + baseline:  user-visible-path measurement + named baseline
interpreter behavior:    for in-process native work, where heavy work yields Python
semantic comparison:     identity | documented tolerance | protocol equivalence
fallback behavior:       none | Python-only path | explicit user-selected fallback |
                         rejected before execution
capability check:        for subset/native modes, how unsupported features are rejected
protocol version:        for workers, schema/channel version
python-only preserved:   base installs, imports, runs, and passes its suite without native code
packaging impact:        none | same package native artifact | worker artifact | split package
unsafe Rust:             none | SAFETY comments and tests identified
```

For a worker, the record names the ADR that defines the protocol and execution-mode boundary.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Native code has a measured reason to exist before implementation starts.
- The boundary shape, crossing frequency, and test burden are fixed before review.
- Drop-in accelerators remain governed by strict Python compatibility rules.
- Engines and workers can exist without pretending to be transparent accelerators.
- Native speedups are less likely to be erased by per-item FFI cost.
- Native logic can be tested separately from Python bindings.

### Tradeoffs

- The project maintains boundary types, plan types, or protocol types where native engines or
  workers exist.
- Some native ideas are rejected because the boundary is too fine-grained or the packaging cost
  is too high.
- Engines and workers require more tests than pure Python alone.
- Declarative native subsets must be treated as explicit capabilities, not transparent
  acceleration.

### Risks

Shape inflation: a simple accelerator may be called an engine to avoid ADR 001. The ordered
classification rule mitigates this by checking the accelerator shape first.

Hidden lifecycle: a callable may quietly spawn a worker. The rule that each boundary is governed
by its own shape mitigates this.

Semantic drift: native behavior may diverge from Python behavior. The mitigation is shared
compatibility tests for accelerators, semantic comparison tests for engines, and protocol
contract tests for workers.

Silent fallback: native failures may be hidden by broad fallback behavior. The mitigation is
explicit fallback policy and tests that fail on unexpected native import, runtime, or protocol
errors.

Boundary creep: a coarse boundary may decay into per-item calls. The mitigation is the native
change record's crossing-frequency field and benchmark requirement.

## Relationship to ADR 001

ADR 001 governs drop-in accelerators: native implementations that replace public Python APIs
while preserving observable behavior.

This ADR governs native boundaries that are not simple drop-ins: in-process engines over plans,
batches, or scoped state, and independent workers behind protocols.

ADR 001 remains binding for any public API exposed as a transparent replacement for pure Python
behavior. Engines and workers are not held to ADR 001's exact-match model unless they also expose
an accelerator boundary, but they remain Python-first: Python-only operation must continue to
work unless a later ADR explicitly grants an exemption, and native tests never replace the
Python-only suite.

## Final position

Rust may make the project faster, more predictable, or better able to integrate with native
platform boundaries. It must not make the project less Pythonic, less portable, less tested, less
explicit, or less predictable.

The public Python API owns user semantics. Rust earns its place at measured, coarse, explicit
boundaries.
